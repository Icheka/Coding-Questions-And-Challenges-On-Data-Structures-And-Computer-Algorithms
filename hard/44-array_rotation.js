// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArrayRotation(arr) take the arr parameter being passed which will be an array of non-negative integers and circularly rotate the array starting from the Nth element where N is equal to the first integer in the array. For example: if arr is [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 10] then your program should rotate the array starting from the 2nd position because the first element in the array is 2. The final array will therefore be
// [4, 1, 6, 10, 2, 3], and your program should return the new array as a string, so for this example your program would return 4161023. The first element in the array will always be an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than the size of the array.
