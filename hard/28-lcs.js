// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function LCS(strArr) take the strArr parameter being passed which will be an array of two strings containing only the characters {a,b,c} and have your program return the length of the longest common subsequence common to both strings. A common subsequence for two strings does not require each character to occupy consecutive positions within the original strings. For example: if strArr is ["abcabb","bacb"] then your program should return 3 because one longest common subsequence for these two strings is "bab" and there are also other 3-length subsequences such as "acb" and "bcb" but 3 is the longest common subsequence for these two strings.

// Hard challenges are worth 15 points and you are not timed for them.
// Sample Test Cases
// Input:"abc","cb"
// Output:1
//
// Input:"bcacb","aacabb"
// Output:3
