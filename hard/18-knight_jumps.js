// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function KnightJumps(str) read str which will be a string consisting of the location of a knight on a standard 8x8 chess board with no other pieces on the board. The structure of str will be the following: "(x y)" which represents the position of the knight with x and y ranging from 1 to 8. Your program should determine the number of spaces the knight can move to from a given location. For example: if str is "(4 5)" then your program should output 8 because the knight can move to 8 different spaces from position x=4 and y=5.
