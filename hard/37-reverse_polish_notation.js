// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function ReversePolishNotation(str) read str which will be an arithmetic expression composed of only integers and the operators: +,-,* and / and the input expression will be in postfix notation (Reverse Polish notation), an example: (1 + 2) * 3 would be
// 1 2 + 3 * in postfix notation. Your program should determine the answer for the given postfix expression. For example: if str is 2 12 + 7 / then your program should output 2.
//

// Sample Test Cases
// Input:"1 1 + 1 + 1 +"
// Output:4
//
