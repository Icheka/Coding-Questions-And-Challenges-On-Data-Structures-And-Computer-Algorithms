// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function StepWalking(num) take the num parameter being passed which will be an integer between 1 and 15 that represents the number of stairs you will have to climb. You can climb the set of stairs by taking either 1 step or 2 steps, and you can combine these in any order. So for example, to climb 3 steps you can either do: (1 step, 1 step, 1 step) or (2, 1) or (1, 2). So for 3 steps we have 3 different ways to climb them, so your program should return 3. Your program should return the number of combinations of climbing num steps.
