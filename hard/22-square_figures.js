// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function SquareFigures(num) read num which will be an integer. Your program should return the smallest integer that when squared has a length equal to num. For example: if num is 6 then your program should output 317 because 317^2 = 100489 while 316^2 = 99856 which does not have a length of six.
