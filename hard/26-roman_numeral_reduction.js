// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function RomanNumeralReduction(str) read str which will be a string of roman numerals in decreasing order. The numerals being used are: I for 1, V for 5, X for 10, L for 50, C for 100, D for 500 and M for 1000. Your program should return the same number given by str using a smaller set of roman numerals. For example: if str is "LLLXXXVVVV" this is 200, so your program should return CC because this is the shortest way to write 200 using the roman numeral system given above. If a string is given in its shortest form, just return that same string.
