// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function FarthestNodes(strArr) read strArr which will be an array of hyphenated letters representing paths between those two nodes. For example: ["a-b","b-c","b-d"] means that there is a path from node a to b (and b to a), b to c, and b to d. Your program should determine the longest path that exists in the graph and return the length of that path. So for the example above, your program should return 2 because of the paths a-b-c and d-b-c. The path a-b-c also means that there is a path c-b-a. No cycles will exist in the graph and every node will be connected to some other node in the graph.
