// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArrayJumping(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and first determine the largest element in the array, and then determine whether or not you can reach that same element within the array by moving left or right continuously according to whatever integer is in the current spot. If you can reach the same spot within the array, then your program should output the least amount of jumps it took. For example: if the input is [2, 3, 5, 6, 1] you'll start at the spot where 6 is and if you jump 6 spaces to the right while looping around the array you end up at the last element where the 1 is. Then from here you jump 1 space to the left and you're back where you started, so your program should output 2. If it's impossible to end up back at the largest element in the array your program should output -1. The largest element in the array will never equal the number of elements in the array. The largest element will be unique.
