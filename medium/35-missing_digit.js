// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function MissingDigit(str) take the str parameter, which will be a simple mathematical formula with three numbers, a single operator (+, -, *, or /) and an equal sign (=) and return the digit that completes the equation. In one of the numbers in the equation, there will be an x character, and your program should determine what digit is missing. For example, if str is "3x + 12 = 46" then your program should output 4. The x character can appear in any of the three numbers and all three numbers will be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1000000.
// Sample Test Cases
// Input:"4 - 2 = x"
// Output:2
//
// Input:"1x0 * 12 = 1200"
// Output:0
