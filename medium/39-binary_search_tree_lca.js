// Challenge
// Using the JavaScript language, have the function BinarySearchTreeLCA(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain 3 elements: the first element will be a binary search tree with all unique values in a preorder traversal array, the second and third elements will be two different values, and your goal is to find the lowest common ancestor of these two values. For example: if strArr is ["[10, 5, 1, 7, 40, 50]", "1", "7"] then this tree looks like the following:
//
//
//
// For the input above, your program should return 5 because that is the value of the node that is the LCA of the two nodes with values 1 and 7. You can assume the two nodes you are searching for in the tree will exist somewhere in the tree.
// Sample Test Cases
// Input:"[10, 5, 1, 7, 40, 50]", "5", "10"
// Output:10
//
// Input:"[3, 2, 1, 12, 4, 5, 13]", "5", "13"
// Output:12
